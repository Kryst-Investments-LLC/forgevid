# ForgeVid TODO — "Generate videos like InVideo"

Derived from the 2026-07-07 code audit. Ordered by the recommended build order.
Each item has a file pointer and an acceptance criterion so "done" is verifiable.

**Status legend:** `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done (needs a passing verification command in the same session)

## Progress log

**2026-07-07 — Phase 0 done; Phase 1 core done.**
- Repo isolated at `C:\Users\yanp0\dev\forgevid` (was rooted at OneDrive; 654 files were unretrievable OneDrive placeholders — reconstructed from git history). Old OneDrive `.git` still exists and should be neutralized.
- Stale docs/dead code removed; missing deps installed; **`npm run type-check` exits 0** (was 701 errors — the project never compiled).
- Async pipeline built: `lib/video-queue.ts` (Redis-optional BullMQ), `lib/generation-pipeline.ts` (shared orchestrator, fails visibly — no placeholder substitution), `workers/video-worker.ts` (`npm run worker`), `GET /api/ai/jobs/[videoId]` status endpoint. `POST /api/ai` now creates a `Video` row (PROCESSING) and enqueues/inline-runs, returning `videoId` immediately; the dashboard polls real progress instead of a fake timer.
- Verified here: type-check (0 errors) + worker module-graph smoke test. NOT yet verified: end-to-end generation (needs Redis/DB/OpenAI/Pexels/ElevenLabs/Cloudinary keys + ffmpeg).
- Still open in Phase 2: thumbnail generation, `POST /api/videos` (returns 501), add DRAFT/QUEUED to `VideoStatus` enum (needs a DB migration).

**2026-07-08 — Phase 3 done; Phase 8 done; the app builds for the first time.**
- `lib/video-generator.ts` split into `planScenes` → `resolveSceneClips` → `assembleVideo`. Scenes persist to `Video.metadata.scenes`.
- Scene editing: `GET/PATCH /api/videos/[id]/scenes`, `POST /api/videos/[id]/scenes/[sceneId]/swap`, `POST /api/videos/[id]/rerender` (async, same progress endpoint). UI: `components/scene-editor-panel.tsx` on the AI Studio page.
- **Phase 8 done**: deleted `getFallbackVideos()` and the `replicate-video.ts` sample returns — generation now fails visibly instead of shipping Google's `ForBiggerBlazes.mp4`.
- Footage quality: full-description search before keyword fallback + cross-scene clip dedupe (was one keyword, random pick from top 3).
- **`npm run build` now exits 0** (was a hard failure). Root cause: OpenAI/Stripe clients constructed at module scope, plus `ENCRYPTION_KEY`/`JWT_SECRET` throws at import — all deferred via `lib/lazy-client.ts`. Also fixed two prerender errors.
- Caution: `npx tsc` resolves an unrelated `tsc` binary here. **Verify with `npm run type-check` and check the exit code**, not by grepping output.

**2026-07-08 — Phase 4 done (decision: keep FFmpeg, no Remotion/Creatomate).**
- Decision rationale: we already have a working FFmpeg assembler that handles remote assets. Remotion means running a React render farm; Creatomate is per-render cost and ships user content to a third party. Neither is warranted — the timeline export is the same problem the generator already solves.
- `lib/video-export.ts` rewritten: resolves remote assets (was: treated `assetId` as a filesystem path and silently skipped everything), fills timeline gaps with black to preserve timing, mixes audio tracks with `adelay`/`amix`, renders text clips as `drawtext`, cleans temp files in `finally`. Deleted `createPlaceholderVideo` (last Phase 8 placeholder).
- `/api/editor/export` now resolves `assetId` → `MediaAsset.url` and returns 422 for unresolvable clips / empty timelines instead of exporting a blue placeholder.
- **Runtime verified**: `npm run verify:export` renders a real timeline with ffmpeg (gap filler, audio mix, text overlay) and asserts duration/streams/resolution. This is the first behavior-verified component.
- Two real bugs that only running it could find: a corrupted `drawtext` filter (see the precise rule below), and `-shortest` never terminating against `apad` coming out of `filter_complex` (bound output with `-t` instead).

> **fluent-ffmpeg footgun (corrected).** The Phase 4 commit message said fluent "splits outputOptions entries on whitespace". That is imprecise. The real rule (`node_modules/fluent-ffmpeg/lib/options/custom.js`, `split.length === 2`): an array entry is split **only when it contains exactly one space** — so `'-c:v libx264'` splits (intended), a filter with two spaces survives, and a filter with *exactly one* space is torn in half. A two-word caption like `"Opening shot"` therefore corrupted the generator's `-vf`, while `"Test scene 1"` silently worked. **Never pass a filter graph through `outputOptions`** — use `.videoFilters()` or `.complexFilter()`, which pass it as a single argv entry. Covered by a regression case in `npm run verify:generate`.
- Known scope limits: audio embedded in video clips is dropped (audio comes from audio tracks); no multi-video-track layering; `drawtext` relies on a system font (may fail in a bare Linux container — bundle a font before deploying).

**2026-07-08 — Phase 5a done: aspect ratio (16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1).**
- Threaded through the whole path: render size *and* Pexels search orientation (landscape footage in a 9:16 frame is mostly letterbox). Persisted in `metadata.request.aspectRatio` so re-render and scene-swap keep the shape.
- UI selector on the AI Studio page; `resolution` now written to the `Video` row.
- `assembleVideo` accepts local source paths (not just URLs), so it is testable offline; it now deletes only files it created.
- **Runtime verified**: `npm run verify:generate` renders all three ratios with ffmpeg and asserts 1920x1080 / 1080x1920 / 1080x1080 + durations, plus a guard that caller-owned sources survive cleanup.

**2026-07-08 — Phase 5b done: background music + ducking.**
- `lib/music-library.ts` reads `public/music/tracks.json` (moods → track). **No tracks are bundled** — music needs a license; see `public/music/README.md`. Empty library ⇒ generation still succeeds, just silent. The UI's "Background Music" add-on was already there and inert; it now does something.
- Music is looped (`-stream_loop -1`) and ducked under narration via `sidechaincompress`. The final pass moved from `-vf` to `complexFilter` (ffmpeg accepts one or the other, not both).
- `assembleVideo` gained `AssembleOptions { musicPath, musicVolume, voiceoverPath }`. Injecting a voiceover lets a re-render skip a paid TTS call — and makes the whole assembler testable offline.
- **Runtime verified, and it caught two real bugs:**
  1. `sidechaincompress` stops when its *sidechain key* ends, so the music died the instant narration stopped (audio ended at 2s of a 4s video). Fixed by `apad`-ing the key + `amix=duration=longest`.
  2. the cleanup block unlinked `voiceoverPath` unconditionally, deleting a caller-injected voiceover.
  Ducking is *measured*, not assumed: `volumedetect` shows −40 dB under narration vs −36.1 dB after it ends.

**2026-07-08 — Phase 5d done: voice catalog + selection.**
- `lib/voice-catalog.ts` is now the single source of voices and the TTS model. The hardcoded voice id (`ErXwobaYiN019PkySvjV`) appeared in two places and the model was the deprecated `eleven_monolingual_v1` → now `eleven_multilingual_v2`.
- 8 ElevenLabs voices, `GET /api/voices` (static catalog, so the UI populates before a key exists), voice picker in the AI Studio shown when the Voiceover add-on is on. Unknown ids fall back to the default rather than being sent to the API.
- Default stays Antoni, so existing projects don't silently change voice.
- `voiceId` persists in `metadata.request` so re-render reuses it.
- Verified by type-check + build + the renderer suites; **not** runtime-verified end-to-end (needs an `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`).

**2026-07-08 — Phase 5c done: real captions + SRT/VTT export.**
- `lib/captions.ts`: `transcribeToCues()` (Whisper `verbose_json` segments) → timed cues aligned to the *spoken narration*, replacing the old "burn in the scene description" behaviour. Degrades cleanly: no voiceover or no `OPENAI_API_KEY` ⇒ falls back to one cue per scene (the old behaviour), never fails the job.
- Word wrap, multi-line stacking, and `CAPTION_PRESETS` (default / large / subtle).
- Cues persist to `metadata.captions`; `GET /api/videos/[id]/captions?format=srt|vtt|json` downloads them, with SRT/VTT buttons in the scene panel.
- Burned in with `drawtext`, deliberately **not** the `subtitles` filter: avoids a libass dependency in the deploy image and avoids escaping a Windows `C:\...` path inside a filtergraph.
- **Runtime verified**: exact SRT/VTT byte assertions, `wrapText`, and a caption containing `,` `:` `'` and `%` actually rendering — a comma is what separates filters in a filtergraph, so this is the case that would silently break the graph.

**2026-07-08 — Phase 2 complete.**
- **Thumbnails**: a poster frame is grabbed ~1s in, *before* `persistGeneratedVideo` deletes the local render, uploaded to Cloudinary when configured, and written to `Video.thumbnail`. Best-effort — a failed thumbnail never fails a generation. Runtime-verified in `verify:generate` for all three ratios.
- **`POST /api/videos`** no longer returns 501: it creates an empty editor project (a `DRAFT`). Generation stays `POST /api/ai`; upload stays `POST /api/videos/upload`.
- **`VideoStatus` gained `DRAFT` and `QUEUED`** (migration `20260708120000_add_video_status_draft_queued`). Template-instantiated projects are `DRAFT` again (they were mislabelled `PROCESSING`, i.e. "rendering forever"); a generation row starts `QUEUED` and flips to `PROCESSING` when a worker actually picks it up.
  - ⚠ **The migration has never been applied** — there is no database here. `prisma validate` passes and the SQL is two `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS` statements, but run `npx prisma migrate deploy` against a real DB before trusting it. Note `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` requires **PostgreSQL 12+** to run inside a transaction.
- Fixed a Prisma major-version mismatch: CLI was 5.x while `@prisma/client` was 6.x.

**2026-07-08 — Linux deploy blocker fixed: caption font.**
- `drawtext` with no `fontfile` relies on fontconfig finding a "Sans" family. `node:18-alpine` ships **no fonts**, so every captioned render would have died in production with "Cannot find a valid font".
- `resolveCaptionFontFile()` now **searches** `/usr/share/fonts`, `/usr/local/share/fonts`, macOS and Windows font dirs (2 levels deep) for a preferred face, rather than hardcoding a path — Alpine moved DejaVu's install location between releases. `CAPTION_FONT_FILE` overrides. No font ⇒ captions are dropped with a clear error, the video still renders.
- `escapeFontPath()`: a filtergraph uses `:` to separate options, so a Windows `C:\...` path must become `C\:/...`. Verified by rendering with an explicit `fontfile`.
- Dockerfile installs `fontconfig` + `font-dejavu` (falling back to `ttf-dejavu`, since Alpine renamed it). ⚠ **The Docker build is unverified** — no Docker daemon here.
- `lib/video-export.ts` reuses the shared escaper/font resolver (it had a duplicate escaper with the same bug).

**2026-07-08 — Phase 6 done: brand kit + free-tier watermark.**
- `lib/plan.ts`: server-side plan resolution. The app only had a *client* `useSubscription()` hook — a watermark enforced in the browser is decoration. Fails closed: an expired/`past_due` subscription is treated as FREE, so it can't keep unlocking clean output.
- `lib/brand-kit.ts` + `BrandKit` model (migration `20260708130000_add_brand_kit`): logo overlay (opacity, corner), caption colour, brand typeface, intro/outro clips.
- Branding is resolved **from the video's owner at render time**, never from client input, and re-resolved on re-render so a downgrade re-applies the watermark.
- `primaryColor` is interpolated into an ffmpeg filtergraph, so it is hex-validated in two places — a value like `red':x=0,drawtext=text='pwned` is rejected.
- `GET/PUT /api/brand-kit` (PUT is 403 for free plans).
- **Runtime verified**: the plan gate, filtergraph-injection rejection, a branded render with watermark + logo overlay + intro/outro concatenating to exactly 4.00s (proving duration probing + bookend normalization), and `shiftCues` delaying captions by the intro duration.
- Bug avoided by testing: an intro prepended to the render would have made every caption fire early — cues are timed relative to the scenes, so they must shift.
- ⚠ Migration unapplied (no DB here).
- Brand-kit UI shipped as a "Branding" tab in dashboard settings, plus `POST /api/brand-kit/logo` (multipart → Cloudinary). Needed because `/api/media` never actually uploaded anything — it records a url and falls back to a literal `placeholder-<type>-url`.

**2026-07-08 — Phase 7a done: scene transitions (xfade).**
- **Found a bigger bug than the feature.** `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` pins a **2018 build (N-92722)** with no `xfade` (added in ffmpeg 4.3). And `setFfmpegPath(installer.path)` was called unconditionally, so the Dockerfile's `apk add ffmpeg` was overridden — that ancient binary ran in production too.
- `lib/ffmpeg-env.ts`: resolve `FFMPEG_PATH` → `ffmpeg-static` (6.1.1) → system `ffmpeg` → the bundled 2018 build, and **probe filter capabilities** instead of assuming them. `ffmpeg-static` is now a runtime dependency. Transitions degrade to hard cuts with a clear warning on an old binary rather than failing the render.
- `lib/transitions.ts`: xfade **overlaps** clips, so a naive chain of N scenes loses `(N-1)×D` seconds — the fixed-length narration would then outrun the video and every caption would land late. Each clip but the last is padded by `D`, so the total stays `sum(sceneDurations)` and cue times need no adjustment. Duration clamped to half the shortest scene; <100ms is treated as a cut.
- Transition persists in `metadata.request.transition` (validated against the allowed list) so re-render matches.
- **Runtime verified on ffmpeg 6.1.1**: 3×2s scenes with a 0.5s fade render to exactly **6.00s**, hard cuts also 6.00s, plus the padding math and an explicit assertion that the *unpadded* chain would lose 1s (the bug this guards).

**2026-07-08 — Phase 7b done: Ken Burns on stills + photo fallback.**
- `resolveSceneClip` previously **threw** when no video matched a scene, failing the whole generation. It now falls back to a Pexels **photo**, and stills get Ken Burns motion — a still held for seconds reads as a broken video.
- `lib/ken-burns.ts`: `zoompan`'s `d` is in **frames, not seconds** (the classic bug), and zooming a frame already at output size stair-steps — so we supersample 2× before zooming and let zoompan emit at the output size. Direction alternates per scene. Degrades to a static fit if `zoompan` is missing.
- `ResolvedScene.mediaType` is optional so scenes persisted before this still load.
- **Runtime verified**: frame count math, supersampling, and a real render — a still becomes a 3.00s h264 clip at 1920×1080 whose **first and last frames differ**, proving it actually zooms rather than holding static (duration + codec alone would pass for a static hold).

**2026-07-08 — Phase 7 complete, plus the two long-standing items.**
- **`OPENAI_SECRET_KEY`**: correcting an earlier overstatement — it is *documented* (docs, `ENV_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`), so it works if you set **both** vars; but `.env.example` lists only `OPENAI_API_KEY`, so anyone following it got silently dead feature modules. `lib/openai-key.ts` now resolves `OPENAI_API_KEY || OPENAI_SECRET_KEY`. A rename would have broken existing deployments.
- **Replicate: DROPPED.** `lib/replicate-video.ts` deleted. Its only consumer built the transcript as the literal string `Transcribed audio from ${size} byte file` and fed *that* to Zeroscope — the feature never transcribed anything. `/api/voice-to-video` now really transcribes with Whisper and enqueues the normal async pipeline, inheriting scenes/captions/music/branding/progress. Fails visibly (503 no key, 422 unusable audio) instead of inventing a transcript. Also removed a hardcoded `Confidence: 95%` stat and fixed base64 encoding that overflowed on recordings longer than a few seconds.
- **User media** (`lib/user-media.ts`): assets resolve from **ids against the owner** — never urls from the client, or the renderer would fetch arbitrary server-side URLs. They fill scenes in order, so a fully-covered generation **no longer needs `PEXELS_API_KEY`**; a partially-covered one fails visibly and names the coverage. Image assets get Ken Burns.
- **Chat editing** (`lib/scene-ops.ts`, `POST /api/videos/[id]/scenes/chat`): the model only proposes operations from a closed set; a zod boundary + a **pure** `applySceneOps` do the work. A hallucinated scene id, an unknown op, a 900-second scene — all rejected before the DB. Deleting reindexes (captions/user-media depend on `index`) while ids stay stable, and the last scene can't be deleted. The model is never shown clip urls.
- **`OneDrive\.git` neutralized**: moved (not deleted) to `C:\Users\yanp0\dev\forgevid-legacy-onedrive-git\.git` — 274MB, tracked only forgevid, would have swept in 409 personal files. A leftover empty `git init` inside the OneDrive project folder was also removed. **Nothing under OneDrive is a git repo any more.** That history is no longer backed up to the OneDrive cloud.
**2026-07-09 — first UI login, natural voices, avatar picker — all verified over HTTP.**
- **Persistent dev DB**: `npm run db:local` — dedicated cluster on `127.0.0.1:54329`, data in `../forgevid-db`; all migrations applied. `.env.local` carries `DATABASE_URL`/`NEXTAUTH_URL`/`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
- **Two more launch-blockers found by the first real HTTP session**: (1) `express.json()` in `server.js` drained request bodies — **every POST hung forever** while GETs looked healthy; (2) `middleware/csrf.ts` imported Node `crypto`, which the Edge runtime lacks — **the middleware 500'd nearly every route**. Rewritten on Web Crypto.
- **First login verified end-to-end over HTTP**: register 201 -> app CSRF double-submit -> NextAuth credentials 200 -> session -> authed APIs.
- **Natural vs AI voices**: studio radio "AI voice" / "My own recording"; `POST /api/narration` stores an AUDIO MediaAsset; `narrationAssetId` is ownership-checked in the pipeline, replaces TTS, and captions come from Whisper on the user's recording. Verified over HTTP including a **full 8s draft generation through the API** (~30s: QUEUED->script->assembling->COMPLETED, 960x540 h264+AAC, 4 GPT scenes, quota billed, $0.035 booked). The caption read "Oh" because the test sample was a sine-tone cache artifact — proof the transcription ran on the actual uploaded audio.
- **Avatar picker**: "AI Presenter" tab (HeyGen grid with previews, script, aspect, generate+poll). Plan gate verified over HTTP both ways: **403 + upgradeRequired as free; the live 1,264-avatar catalog as Pro**. Renders only start on explicit click.
- Ops traps: curl may take IPv6 `::1` where responses die (use `127.0.0.1`); never pipe a dev server through `head`; the cookie jar holds both `next-auth.csrf-token` and the app `csrf-token` — extract by exact name.

**2026-07-08 — FIRST LIVE PROVIDER RUN (ElevenLabs + HeyGen keys added).**
- Keys had landed in the old OneDrive copy's `.env` (with a duplicate `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`); transplanted the last occurrence of each into `dev/forgevid/.env.local` (gitignored, values never displayed).
- `npm run verify:providers` (new): **all green on the first attempt** —
  - ElevenLabs: key valid, 22 voices; **real speech synthesized through the per-scene pipeline** (2.12s + 1.38s segments); repeat call served entirely from cache (**no charge on re-render — verified live**).
  - Full render with real narration: **scenes were cut to speech** (2.47s/1.73s instead of the requested 5s each) and the output carries the real AAC narration. Kept for listening at `public/generated/`.
  - HeyGen: key valid, **1,264 avatars listed**. No render started — avatar renders bill credits; that stays a UI opt-in.
- Now live-verified: ElevenLabs TTS + per-scene cache + narration pacing + HeyGen auth/list. Still not live-verified: a paid HeyGen render, ElevenLabs voice-add (needs a real voice sample), OpenAI/Pexels/Cloudinary, the Docker build.

**2026-07-08 — avatars, voice cloning, and a collision-proof e2e runner.**
- **Port fix**: `npm run verify:e2e:db` (scripts/run-e2e-with-db.sh) spins a throwaway Postgres on a **random port (49152-63151)**, migrates, runs the suite, tears down on exit — no more collisions with the parallel SHAREDRIVER session's scratch server on 55432. Verified twice (ports 52708, 49187).
- **Voice cloning** (Pro+): `ClonedVoice` model (+migration `20260708160000`), `POST /api/voices/clone` (multipart -> ElevenLabs /v1/voices/add, 503 without key, 502 surfaces provider errors), cloned voices appear in `GET /api/voices` and are valid `voiceId`s. Resolution is ownership-checked: an unowned id falls back to the default and is **never sent upstream** (e2e-verified against the real DB).
- **AI avatars** (Pro+): HeyGen v2 integration (`lib/avatar-provider.ts`), `GET /api/avatars`, `POST /api/avatars/generate` — same contract as every generation (videoId + poll `/api/ai/jobs/[id]`), shares the monthly quota, books $0.50/min into the cost ledger. The **payload builder is pure and pinned by tests** (avatar id, script, dimensions per aspect, optional voice pass-through).
- ⚠ Honesty line: the **live** ElevenLabs voice-add and HeyGen calls are unverified here (no keys). What IS verified: plan gates, quota sharing, ownership checks, payload contract, cost math, migrations on a fresh DB, and that every unconfigured path 503s instead of faking output.
- Lesson (twice now): text written through bash-heredoc→Python can silently turn `
` into a real newline, and `scripts/` is outside the app tsconfig so tsc won't catch it — esbuild does, at run time. Check the suite actually *ran*.

- Suite is now **104 runtime assertions** (`npm run verify:generate`) + `verify:export`.

**2026-07-08 — END-TO-END VERIFIED against a real PostgreSQL database.**
- Ran an isolated Postgres 18 cluster on port 55432 (own data dir, trust auth) so nothing touched the user's own server on 5432. Torn down afterwards.
- **`prisma migrate deploy` applied all migrations cleanly**, including the two hand-written ones (`DRAFT`/`QUEUED`, `brand_kits`). `VideoStatus` really does gain `DRAFT,QUEUED`; `brand_kits` exists with its FK. Those are no longer "unverified".
- **Found a real, pre-existing bug: the migration history did not match `schema.prisma`.** The project had been evolving with `prisma db push`, which records no migration — so a fresh `migrate deploy` produced a schema missing two whole tables (`sso_configurations`, `beta_access_entries`), two `video_exports` columns (`fileUrl`, `progress`) and ~30 indexes. **A clean production deploy would have crashed** on SSO lookups and editor exports. Fixed by `20260708140000_sync_schema_drift`; `prisma migrate diff --exit-code` now reports **no drift**.
- `npm run verify:e2e` drives the real pipeline (no external APIs needed — user media covers the scenes, the script falls back to the prompt, the render stays local) and asserts against the database: `QUEUED → PROCESSING → COMPLETED`, url/resolution/thumbnail persisted, the mp4 and thumbnail exist on disk, scenes + captions persisted, the user's own media used instead of stock, re-render honours edited scene durations (2+2+2 = 6.00s), and the plan gate resolves free → watermark, ACTIVE pro → clean, **PAST_DUE → back to watermark (fails closed)**.
- The fail-visibly path is asserted for real: with no media and no `PEXELS_API_KEY` the job **throws**, the row is `FAILED`, the stored error names the missing key, and **no url is written**.
- Teardown note: `subscriptions_userId_fkey` is `RESTRICT`, not `CASCADE`, so deleting a user requires deleting its subscriptions first.
- Still unverified: OpenAI/ElevenLabs/Pexels/Cloudinary calls (no keys), the Docker build (no daemon), and the HTTP routes themselves (need a NextAuth session).

**2026-07-08 — Tier 1 revenue hardening (pre-launch blockers).**
- **Editor export watermark hole closed**: `exportTimelineVideo` takes `watermarkText`, and `/api/editor/export` resolves it from the **owner's plan server-side** (client input for it is discarded). Verified by rendering the same timeline with and without the watermark and asserting the outputs differ at the byte level.
- **Quotas** (`lib/quota.ts`): free 3 videos/mo & 60s max, starter 20/180s, pro 100/600s. Enforced in `/api/ai` and `/api/voice-to-video` (voice input isn't a bypass); usage recorded on job *acceptance* so requeue-while-running can't dodge it; fails closed on lookup errors. Rejections name the limit and carry `upgradeRequired` — that's the Stripe upgrade pressure. Verified against real `UsageRecord` rows (duration cap, 4th-video rejection, pro lift).
- **Render semaphore** (`lib/render-semaphore.ts`, `RENDER_CONCURRENCY`, default 2): throttles the no-Redis inline path on all three routes (generate, re-render, voice-to-video). Verified: 5 concurrent jobs never exceed 2 active, FIFO order, failed job releases its slot.
- **Cost ledger** (`lib/cost-ledger.ts`): every generation writes an `AIGeneration` row with an estimated cost (GPT tokens from the real response, TTS chars, Whisper minutes, render minutes; rates in `RATES`). Recorded in the *pipeline*, so worker and inline both book. Admin revenue now returns `aiCosts` (period/all-time spend, generation counts, gross margin vs MRR). Verified: the e2e generation booked $0.006917 for a 6s render.

**2026-07-08 — Tier 2 output-quality multipliers.**
- **Narration-paced scenes + per-scene TTS cache** (`lib/voiceover.ts`) — items #5 and #7 as one mechanism. Each scene's line is synthesized separately (cached by `sha256(description|voice|model)` in `.cache/tts/`), and **the audio decides the scene's duration** (`audio + 0.35s`), so scenes are cut to speech instead of speech being trimmed/padded to GPT's guesses. Cues come per-scene for free (no Whisper charge on this path). Verified with an injectable synth: 10s requested → 3.80s speech-length video; **zero synth calls on an unchanged re-render**; editing one scene re-synthesizes only that scene; cue 2 starts exactly at scene 2. Falls back to whole-narration synthesis (and Whisper cues) when per-scene fails.
- **Per-scene thumbnails**: extracted from the trimmed clips before the xfade pass merges them; persisted on each scene; shown in the scene editor panel. Verified for all three aspect ratios.
- **Draft previews** (`renderQuality: 'draft'`): half resolution + `ultrafast`/crf 30 (exports stay `slow`/18). "Fast draft preview" checkbox in the AI Studio; re-render reuses the stored quality. Verified: 960×540, full duration kept.
- `assembleVideo` now returns the scenes **as rendered** (paced durations + thumbs) and both generate and re-render persist those — otherwise the editor drifts from the video.

**2026-07-08 — Tier 3 growth loop + the product loop (platform memory).**
- **Product loop** (`lib/product-loop.ts`) — record → recall → reflect:
  - *Record*: re-renders, scene edits, chat edits, clip swaps, caption downloads and share-enables all land in `UsageRecord` (generations already did via quota).
  - *Recall*: `GET /api/me/defaults` learns the user's most-used style/aspect/voice from their own videos; the AI Studio opens pre-set to it. **The platform remembers how each user works.**
  - *Reflect*: `GET /api/admin/product-insights` — failure rate, re-render rate, hand-edit volume, style demand, unit cost. The numbers that say what to fix next, and the labelled usage dataset a future model for this platform trains on.
  - Verified against the real DB: events land, defaults learned (`modern`/`16:9` from real videos), insights count generations/re-renders/edits and expose $0.006917/gen.
- **Share pages**: `/v/[videoId]` (server-rendered, real OG tags) + `POST /api/videos/[id]/share` toggle + Share button. **Opt-in per video** — never id-guessable. The free-tier watermark is now a growth channel.
- **Completion email**: pipeline sends "your video is ready" on COMPLETED (best-effort; SMTP optional).
- **Template → AI bridge**: "Generate with AI" on template cards prefills the AI Studio via query params; explicit params beat learned defaults.
- **Transition picker** (9 xfade types + hard cuts) and **4K** (`renderQuality: '4k'`, 3840×2160 / 2160×3840 / 2160², **Pro-plan gated server-side**). Draft/full/4K select in the Studio. Dims verified.
- **Provider-blocked, deliberately NOT built**: AI avatars and voice cloning need external providers (HeyGen-class / ElevenLabs voice-add) with keys this environment doesn't have — stubbing them would violate the fail-visibly rule. Team-collaboration polish deferred (Socket.IO server exists).
- ⚠ Lesson: the scratch-Postgres port (55432) collided with another Claude session's scratch server (SHAREDRIVER BOT); the later e2e runs transparently used that instance. Results remain valid (same PG 18, own database, dropped afterwards) — but future runs should pick a random high port.

## Phase 0 — Repo hygiene (do before any feature work)

- [ ] Commit or deliberately revert the working tree (510 uncommitted files, ~60 deleted status MDs).
  - _Accept:_ `git status --short` is empty; one real commit message describing the cleanup.
- [ ] Fix `npm run type-check` — missing type defs for `jsonwebtoken`, `node-fetch`, `triple-beam`, `uuid`.
  - Try clean `npm install` first; add `@types/*` only if still missing.
  - _Accept:_ `npm run type-check` exits 0.
- [ ] Remove the ~40 stale status/audit `*.md` files and loose `forgevid-*.html` test files from the repo root.
  - _Accept:_ root contains only real docs (README, this TODO, LICENSE, config).
- [ ] Check for tracked secrets before next push: `git ls-files | grep -i env`.
  - _Accept:_ no `.env*` with real values tracked.

## Phase 1 — Async generation pipeline (unblocks everything) [P0]

**Problem:** the whole multi-minute pipeline runs synchronously inside `POST /api/ai`
([app/api/ai/route.ts:136](app/api/ai/route.ts#L136)); the UI shows a fake progress bar
([app/dashboard/ai/page.tsx:52-60](app/dashboard/ai/page.tsx#L52-L60)).

- [ ] Delete the unreachable dead code in `app/api/ai/`: `runway.ts`, `upscale.ts`, `sdxl-animatediff.ts`, `image.ts`, `select.ts`, `queue.ts` (App Router only routes `route.ts`). Keep whatever logic is worth salvaging by moving it into `lib/`.
  - _Accept:_ no loose non-`route.ts` handlers left in `app/api/ai/`; build passes.
- [ ] Stand up a real BullMQ queue + a standalone worker process (BullMQ already a dependency; rewrite the demo `video-worker.js`).
  - _Accept:_ enqueuing a job runs it in the worker, not the web request.
- [ ] Move `generateVideoFromPrompt` off the request thread — `POST /api/ai` enqueues a job and returns a `jobId` immediately.
  - _Accept:_ the POST returns in <1s with a job id.
- [ ] Add `GET /api/ai/jobs/[id]` status endpoint (state + real percent + result URL/error).
  - _Accept:_ client can poll and see QUEUED → PROCESSING → READY/FAILED.
- [ ] Emit real progress from the pipeline stages (script, scenes, downloads, assembly, upload) into the job.
  - _Accept:_ progress bar in the UI reflects actual stage, not a timer.
- [ ] Replace the fake `setInterval` progress in [app/dashboard/ai/page.tsx](app/dashboard/ai/page.tsx) with polling of the status endpoint.
  - _Accept:_ bar advances from server events; survives page refresh.
- [ ] Worker concurrency limit + graceful shutdown so FFmpeg doesn't pile up.
  - _Accept:_ N concurrent generations never exceed the configured worker concurrency.

---

## Phase 2 — Persist generations as real Videos [P0]

**Problem:** generation writes an `AIGeneration` row but never a `Video`; `POST /api/videos` returns 501
([app/api/videos/route.ts:75](app/api/videos/route.ts#L75)).

- [ ] Create a `Video` record at job enqueue with status transitions (add `QUEUED`/`FAILED` to `VideoStatus` if missing).
  - _Accept:_ every generation appears in "My Videos" immediately with a live status.
- [ ] On success, store the final Cloudinary URL, duration, resolution, thumbnail on the `Video`.
  - _Accept:_ generated video is downloadable after the 24h temp cleanup.
- [ ] Implement `POST /api/videos` (currently 501) or remove it and document the generation entrypoint.
  - _Accept:_ no route returns 501 in the happy path.
- [ ] Generate + store a thumbnail (FFmpeg frame grab) for the grid.
  - _Accept:_ "My Videos" shows a real thumbnail, not a placeholder.

---

## Phase 3 — Scene-based post-editing (InVideo signature) [P0]

**Problem:** the pipeline computes a scene list then bakes a flat MP4 and discards it; the
dnd-kit timeline ([components/timeline.tsx](components/timeline.tsx)) is disconnected from generation.

- [ ] Persist the scene list to the project `metadata`: per scene = script line, keywords, chosen clip URL, duration, voiceover segment, caption.
  - _Accept:_ a generated project reloads with its full scene structure.
- [ ] Load the persisted scenes into the timeline editor as tracks/clips.
  - _Accept:_ opening a generated video in the editor shows its scenes, not an empty timeline.
- [ ] Per-scene "swap clip" — re-search Pexels for that scene and replace the clip.
  - _Accept:_ swapping one scene doesn't touch the others.
- [ ] Per-scene "regenerate" — re-run script→footage→voiceover for a single scene.
  - _Accept:_ a single scene re-renders and the project re-assembles.
- [ ] Re-render the project from the edited scene list (feeds Phase 4 renderer).
  - _Accept:_ edited scenes produce a new final MP4.

---

## Phase 4 — Fix / replace the timeline renderer [P0]

**Problem:** [lib/video-export.ts:138-150](lib/video-export.ts#L138-L150) treats `clip.assetId` as a
local path and `fs.existsSync`-skips Cloudinary URLs; the complex filter builds `[v00]` labels that are
never concatenated/overlaid/mapped; text tracks ignored; no transitions. `lib/video-processing.ts` is a mock.

- [ ] **Decision first:** hand-rolled FFmpeg graph vs. Remotion vs. API renderer (Shotstack/Creatomate). Record the choice + rationale here.
  - _Accept:_ decision documented before renderer code is written.
- [ ] Download/cache remote (Cloudinary/Pexels) assets to a temp dir before FFmpeg.
  - _Accept:_ a timeline of URL-based clips renders (no silent skips).
- [ ] Build a correct filter graph: trim → scale/pad → xfade/concat → drawtext/subtitles → amix (with ducking).
  - _Accept:_ output actually contains every clip, in order, with audio.
- [ ] Render text/caption tracks (currently ignored).
  - _Accept:_ text clips appear in the output.
- [ ] Replace the `lib/video-processing.ts` mock (`processVideo` returns `example.com/processed-video.mp4`).
  - _Accept:_ no mock URLs returned from real endpoints.
- [ ] Remove placeholder fallbacks that ship third-party sample videos to users (see Phase 8).

## Phase 5 — Audio, captions, voice, aspect ratio [P0]

### Background music
- [ ] Add a licensed music library (20–50 tracks) with mood metadata.
  - _Accept:_ tracks exist with license records.
- [ ] Wire mood-based selection to the emotion-ai output (`musicTracks` names currently map to nothing).
  - _Accept:_ detected emotion selects a real track.
- [ ] Audio ducking: lower music under the voiceover (FFmpeg `sidechaincompress` / volume automation).
  - _Accept:_ narration is audible over music in the output.

### Real captions (not scene descriptions)
- [ ] Word-timed captions from the actual narration via Whisper (or ElevenLabs timestamps) — replace the drawtext-of-scene-description in [lib/video-generator.ts:160](lib/video-generator.ts#L160).
  - _Accept:_ captions match spoken words and timing.
- [ ] Styled caption presets (position, font, highlight).
  - _Accept:_ user can pick a caption style.
- [ ] SRT/VTT export.
  - _Accept:_ downloadable subtitle file matches the video.

### Voice selection
- [ ] Remove the hardcoded voice ID `ErXwobaYiN019PkySvjV` + deprecated `eleven_monolingual_v1` (two places: [lib/video-generator.ts:122](lib/video-generator.ts#L122), [app/api/ai/route.ts:27](app/api/ai/route.ts#L27)).
- [ ] Voice catalog + preview + selection in the generate UI; upgrade to `eleven_multilingual_v2` (OpenAI TTS as cheap tier).
  - _Accept:_ user picks a voice; it's used in the render.

### Aspect ratio
- [ ] Parameterize the hardcoded `1920:1080` scale/pad; support 16:9, 9:16, 1:1.
  - _Accept:_ generating in 9:16 produces a vertical video end-to-end (trim + assembly + captions).

---

## Phase 6 — Brand kit + free-tier watermark [P1]

- [ ] Brand kit: logo, colors, fonts, intro/outro stored per user/org.
  - _Accept:_ brand assets persist and apply to a render.
- [ ] Free-tier watermark tied to existing Stripe plan gating.
  - _Accept:_ free plan renders carry a watermark; paid plans don't.

---

## Phase 7 — Quality parity with InVideo [P1]

- [ ] Better footage matching: search the full scene phrase, score candidates, dedupe clips across scenes (currently one keyword at a time, random pick from top 3 in [lib/video-generator.ts:486-491](lib/video-generator.ts#L486-L491)).
  - _Accept:_ no repeated clip across scenes in a typical run.
- [ ] Transitions & motion: crossfades (`xfade`), Ken Burns on stills, animated text presets.
- [ ] User media in generations: let "use my product shots" pull from `MediaAsset`.
- [ ] Chat-based editing ("make scene 2 faster") operating on the Phase 3 scene structure (chat panel + `ai-editing` route are scaffolding today).
- [ ] Modernize or delete the Replicate path: Zeroscope v2 XL / that SVD version are 2023-era, 576p/8fps. Either integrate current-gen text-to-video (Kling/Wan/Veo/Runway) as a premium add-on, or delete ([lib/replicate-video.ts](lib/replicate-video.ts)).
- [ ] Rendering infra: confirm persistent VM/container target (not serverless — writes to `public/temp`/`public/generated`); add disk cleanup + concurrency limits. Docker setup already supports this.

---

## Phase 8 — Fail visibly, never ship placeholders [P0 correctness]

- [ ] Remove silent fallback to Google sample videos (`ForBiggerBlazes.mp4`) at [lib/replicate-video.ts:164](lib/replicate-video.ts#L164) and the Pexels fallback in [lib/video-generator.ts:240](lib/video-generator.ts#L240).
  - _Accept:_ a failed generation surfaces an error to the user; no third-party demo video is ever returned as "your video."

---

## Phase 9 — Later [P2]

- [ ] AI avatars
- [ ] Voice cloning
- [ ] Multi-language generation
- [ ] Team collaboration polish (Socket.IO server exists)
- [ ] 4K export
- [ ] GIF export
- [ ] Template marketplace moderation flows

---

## Portfolio decision (blocking gate)

- [ ] **Decide whether ForgeVid earns build capacity.** Global rules put 100% on SHAREDRIVER BOT; ForgeVid isn't on the active list. Phases 1–5 (P0) are ~4–8 weeks of solo work. Make this call before starting Phase 1.
